# Functional Scala Exercises

This repository contains my (working) implementations of the programming exercises in the book [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). Learning functional Scala has always been of my interest and also is a component during my work at [Azavea](https://github.com/azavea) on [Raster Foundry Team](https://github.com/raster-foundry/).

_Note_ :

* Files appended by `-not-me` means that the solution was entirely inspired by some online suggestions. If `-partly` is appended, it means that the exercise has multiple questions, and only part(s) are done by myself. These mean the exercises may need later revision for me to better internalize

* Files appended by `-has-better` means that they include a better (in terms of efficiency, stack safety, etc) solution posted online.

* Files appended by `-by-hint` means that I came up with the detailed solution after looking for hints, which means they may need a second look to digest better.
