# Functional Scala Exercises

This repository contains my (working) implementations of the programming exercises in the book [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). Learning functional Scala has always been of my interest and also is a component during my work at [Azavea](https://github.com/azavea) on [Raster Foundry Team](https://github.com/raster-foundry/).
